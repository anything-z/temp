# CREDIT UNION WEB APP - CUWA v1.0
==================================

This proposal is to provide the following web based services for the members of any credit union that use Abacus.

1. View Statement
2. Download Statement as PDF
3. Apply for Loans
4. Transfer funds between credit union members
5. Withdraw funds

Gambian credit unions handle these services using paper forms and manual procedures. With CUWA these procedures will be automated and digitized. Data collected will be securely saved in a database where authorized staff can provide access to the data.

In addition to the services for members the following functionality will be provided for credit union staff to augment operating procedures

1. View/Approve/Deny loan applications
2. View/Approve/Deny funds transfer
3. View/Approve/Deny funds withdrawal
4. Manage staff access and permission

This service has been developed and is in operation at the MRC Credit Union.

# TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
The service is installed on a separate server and requires read-only access to Abacus. 

Loan applications, funds transfer and funds withdrawal will result in information about these request saved in the service database that are visible by authorized credit union staff. 

All requests need to be approved by credit union staff and entered manually into Abacus using existing procedures. 

This ensures that all entry and update of member account transactions are under the full control of credit union staff using Abacus.
